So, I suppose I must writing my life here, but it will be a bit short because I'm not English or American, no, I'm French and I bad at English. I'm sure, I've done some false sentences. Oops -_-. So, I'm... Wait ?? Why this is in italic now ? Shit, I think it's because I've write "-", so I've discoverd this, cool ! But, how can I suppose to remove this ? Hum, with this trouble, I haven't introduce me. Sorry, so I begin here : I'm a passionate about informatic and programmation. It's so short ðŸ˜‚. And I love cookies. Not on the Internet, no, in real life, those can you eat. But my favourite one is the space cookies ;)
