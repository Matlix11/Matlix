So, I suppose I must writing my life here, but it will be a bit short because I'm not English or American, no, I'm French and I bad at English. I'm sure, I've done some false sentences. Oops -_-. So, I'm a passionate about informatic and programmation. (It's so short ðŸ˜‚). And I love cookies. Not on the Internet, no, in real life, those can you eat. But my favourite one is the space cookies ;)
